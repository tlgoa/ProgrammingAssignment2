##Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.


## It creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse)
}


## It computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache. For this assignment, we assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data.")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
